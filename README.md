# database.c

The goal of this toy program is simply for me to get somewhat comfortable with C programming. I want to implement a (very simple) relational-like database, probably in-memory only, because this is a project that provides an ample enough playground for experimentation along various paths.

I know next to nothing about actual database design and implementations and I want to keep it that way for now, so I can try out my own ideas and see where they will (inevitably) fail.
